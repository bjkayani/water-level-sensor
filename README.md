# Water Level Sensor
 Wireless Water Tank Level Sensor

## Background
I needed a way to monitor the water level in the overhead water tank. I found commercial solutions but they were expensive and not very customizable
so I decided to build my own.

## Working
The system is based on a transmitter and receiver communicating wirelessly over RF using the HC-12 module. The transmitter has an ultrasonic sensor for level measurement and is powered by a solar panel and 18650 battery backup. I also added a temperature and humidity sensor for added data. The reciever is based on the ESP8266 module and is connected to the Blynk app. It also has an LCD to display the readings. 

## Details
Coming soon...
